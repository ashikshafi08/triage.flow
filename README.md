## üí¨ How to Use the Agentic Chat Interface

### Agentic Repository Analysis Commands
- **Overview**: "What is this repository about?" - *Agent explores structure, reads key files, analyzes patterns*
- **Architecture**: "Explain the project structure" - *Agent navigates directories, examines relationships*
- **Code exploration**: "Show me the main components" - *Agent searches, categorizes, and explains findings*
- **Debugging**: "Help me understand this error in @file.py" - *Agent reads file, searches for related code, analyzes context*
- **Implementation**: "How does the authentication work?" - *Agent searches auth patterns, traces code flow*

### Watch the AI Think
- **Thought steps** show the agent's reasoning process
- **Action steps** display which tools the agent chooses to use
- **Observation steps** show the results of tool execution
- **Answer steps** provide the final synthesized response

### Smart Context Features
- **File references**: "Look at @config.py for the settings"
- **Folder exploration**: "What's in @folder/src/components?"
- **Multi-file analysis**: "Compare @file1.js and @file2.js"
- **Complex queries**: "Find all database-related files and explain the schema"
- **Autocomplete suggestions**: Type `@` to see file/folder suggestions with fuzzy search
- **Integrated file viewing**: Click files in the explorer to view them alongside chat

### Pro Tips
- Use **@** for file autocomplete (optimized for large repos)
- **Arrow keys** navigate autocomplete suggestions, **Enter/Tab** to select
- **Ask complex questions** - the agent will break them down automatically
- **Watch the reasoning** - each step shows how the AI approaches your problem
