{"id":297,"state":"closed","title":"Error Handling in run_graph","body":"The code appears well-structured and implements a LangGraph workflow for managing a portfolio with risk assessment. However, there are a few areas that could be improved:\n\n\n\n1.`**: The `run_graph` function doesn't handle potential exceptions during the `graph.invoke` call. It's recommended to add a try-except block to catch and log any errors during the graph execution.\n\n\n\n2. **Parameter validation**: Consider adding parameter validation within `run_graph` and `create_graph` to ensure correct types are being passed and that parameters such as `tickers` and `selected_agents` are not empty when they should not be.\n\n\n\n3. **Clarity of Analyst Node Creation**: The creation of `analyst_nodes` is a bit dense. Consider breaking this down into smaller steps for readability, especially if the configuration is complex.\n\n\n\n4. **`start` function**: The code uses a `start` function imported from `src.main`, but there is no context on what the function does. Without this context, it's difficult to review. It is being used as a node in the graph, so it probably has a defined input and output. This information might be relevant for a more in-depth review.\n\n\n\n5. **Type Hints**: While type hints are used, they can be more comprehensive, especially within `run_graph` function. Adding return type hint will improve code clarity.\n\n\n\n6. **Asyncio Best Practices**: The use of `asyncio.get_running_loop()` is generally fine, but consider using `asyncio.to_thread` in Python 3.9+ as it's slightly more concise and recommended for running synchronous functions in a separate thread within an async context.\n\n\ncode is here...\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nimport json\nfrom typing import List, Dict, Any\nfrom langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage\nfrom langgraph.graph import END, StateGraph\n\nfrom src.agents.portfolio_manager import portfolio_management_agent\nfrom src.agents.risk_manager import risk_management_agent\nfrom src.main import start\nfrom src.utils.analysts import ANALYST_CONFIG\nfrom src.graph.state import AgentState\n\n\n# Helper function to create the agent graph\ndef create_graph(selected_agents: List[str]) -> StateGraph:\n    \"\"\"Create the workflow with selected agents.\"\"\"\n    graph = StateGraph(AgentState)\n    graph.add_node(","comments":[],"labels":["bug"],"created_at":"2025-05-21T12:16:29+00:00","closed_at":"2025-05-21T12:20:51+00:00","patch_url":null,"repo":"virattt/ai-hedge-fund","similarity_score":null}
{"id":296,"state":"closed","title":"Error handling in get_start_date","body":"The code appears to be well-structured and follows good practices. However, there are a couple of minor points to consider:\n\n\n\n1. **Error Handling in `get_start_date`:** The `get_start_date` method assumes that `self.end_date` is always in the correct format (`%Y-%m-%d`). If `self.end_date` is invalid, it will raise a `ValueError`. Adding a try-except block to handle potential `ValueError` would improve robustness.\n2. **Default Value for `start_date`:** Currently, if `start_date` is not provided, the code calculates it by subtracting 90 days from the `end_date`. Consider making this calculation directly within the `Field` definition for `start_date` using `default_factory`. This can simplify the logic and improve readability.\n\n\ncode is here....\n\n\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\nfrom typing import List, Optional\nfrom src.llm.models import ModelProvider\n\n\nclass HedgeFundResponse(BaseModel):\n    decisions: dict\n    analyst_signals: dict\n\n\nclass ErrorResponse(BaseModel):\n    message: str\n    error: str | None = None\n\n\nclass HedgeFundRequest(BaseModel):\n    tickers: List[str]\n    selected_agents: List[str]\n    end_date: Optional[str] = Field(default_factory=lambda: datetime.now().strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d\"))\n    start_date: Optional[str] = Field(default_factory=lambda: (datetime.now() - timedelta(days=90)).strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d\"))\n    model_name: str = \"gpt-4o\"\n    model_provider: ModelProvider = ModelProvider.OPENAI\n    initial_cash: float = 100000.0\n    margin_requirement: float = 0.0\n\n\n","comments":[],"labels":["bug"],"created_at":"2025-05-21T12:11:36+00:00","closed_at":"2025-05-21T12:21:06+00:00","patch_url":null,"repo":"virattt/ai-hedge-fund","similarity_score":null}

Since the older data's `report_period` is before the new end_date, the function returns only the old cached data without making an API call to fetch newer reports.\n\n## Expected Behavior\nWhen querying with a newer end_date, the function should check if the cached data contains recent enough entries, and if not, make an API call to fetch the most recent data.\n\n## Root Cause\nThe caching mechanism only checks for the existence of data for a ticker without validating whether that data covers the requested time period adequately. The filter only excludes data that is too recent, but doesn't identify when data is too old or incomplete.\n\n## Proposed Solution\nModify the cache lookup to also check the most recent `report_period` in the cached data:\n\n```python\nif cached_data := _cache.get_financial_metrics(ticker):\n    # Get most recent report in cache\n    most_recent = max(metric[\"report_period\"] for metric in cached_data)\n    \n    # If we have recent enough data, filter and return\n    if most_recent >= end_date or datetime.date.fromisoformat(most_recent) > datetime.date.today() - datetime.timedelta(days=90):\n        filtered_data = [FinancialMetrics(**metric) for metric in cached_data if metric[\"report_period\"] <= end_date]\n        filtered_data.sort(key=lambda x: x.report_period, reverse=True)\n        if filtered_data:\n            return filtered_data[:limit]\n```\n\nThis ensures we only use cached data if it contains sufficiently recent information.\n","comments":[],"labels":["bug"],"created_at":"2025-04-27T09:02:34+00:00","closed_at":"2025-06-03T00:37:27+00:00","patch_url":null,"repo":"virattt/ai-hedge-fund","similarity_score":null}

If I execute the call again asking for `quarterly` results, it will just get the annual results from the cache and return those instead.\n\n2. cache only merges on report_period, ignoring differences between ttm and quarterly results\n\nIf the first issue was fixed by knowing that different keys (report_period) will be returned by using period `annual` and `quarterly`/`ttm`, it will expose this second issue. For some api calls such as `tools.api.get_financial_metrics`, the call supports `annual`, `ttm`, and `quarterly` values for the period param. If you choose `ttm` or `quarterly`, the `report_period` will be the same, but the values will be different, so they need to be cached separately.\n\n```\n>>> [(m.report_period, m.revenue_growth) for m in api.get_financial_metrics('TSLA', end_date='2025-04-03', period='quarterly')]\n[('2024-12-31', 0.020848224922563736), ('2024-09-30', -0.012470588235294117), ('2024-06-30', 0.1971268954509178), ('2024-03-31', -0.15361385941908054), ('2023-12-31', 0.07781584582441113), ('2023-09-30', -0.06326473302041963), ('2023-06-30', 0.06849843542372155), ('2023-03-31', -0.0406694629492557), ('2022-12-31', 0.13349491936235666), ('2022-09-30', 0.2669186252509744)]\n```\n```\n>>> [(m.report_period, m.revenue_growth) for m in api.get_financial_metrics('TSLA', end_date='2025-04-03', period='ttm')]\n[('2024-12-31', 0.0055584148224395264), ('2024-09-30', 0.019219874525273295), ('2024-06-30', 0.006047812549474906), ('2024-03-31', -0.020956258460521012), ('2023-12-31', 0.008850756849172262), ('2023-09-30', 0.020164206406602287), ('2023-06-30', 0.09290405067705004), ('2023-03-31', 0.05613660356976259), ('2022-12-31', 0.0881476831011314), ('2022-09-30', 0.11459667093469911)]\n```\n\nI think the solution is to take the period param into account when caching results.","comments":[],"labels":["bug"],"created_at":"2025-04-03T22:20:07+00:00","closed_at":"2025-06-03T00:37:33+00:00","patch_url":null,"repo":"virattt/ai-hedge-fund","similarity_score":null}
