Please describe.**\nSometimes, my LLM steps ends with `final_answer(...)` not being included in the required \\``py \\`` code block syntax, so smolagents raises an error and starts a new step telling the LLM that the syntax was wrong.\nThe problem comes from the fact that I was using a reasoning LLM (qwen 14b in my case), which first reflects on the problem by generating its reasoning between ``<think> </think>`` tags, at some point, it plans to use the required syntax by generating it in its thoughts, but without code in it.\n\nStep 1 not including the python block syntax : \n```\n<think>                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nOkay, the user wanted to add a component with the text \"hello world\" to their Gradio interface. I used the interface_agent tool to handle that. The agent was instructed to add a text component with the label   \n\"hello world\". The response from the agent said the task was completed. Now I need to confirm that the component was added successfully.                                                                          \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \nI should check if there's any feedback or confirmation needed. Since the user didn't specify further actions, maybe they just want to know it's done. The final answer should be a simple confirmation. Let me    \nmake sure the response is clear and concise.                                                                                                                                                                      \n</think>                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \nThe text component with the label \"hello world\" has been successfully added to the Gradio interface.                                                                                                              \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \nfinal_answer(\"The 'hello world' text component has been added to the Gradio interface.\")\n```\n\nStep 2 thinking about adding it but stopped because the python code block syntax got detected by the parser : \n```\n<think>                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nOkay, the user wants me to add a component with the text \"hello world\" to their Gradio interface. Let me think about how to do this correctly.                                                                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \nFirst, I remember that the interface_agent tool is used for modifying the Gradio interface. So I should use that. The task needs to be clearly described. The user mentioned adding a component with the text     \n\"hello world\", so the label should be \"hello world\".                                                                                                                                                              \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \nWait, in the previous attempt, I called the interface_agent with the correct instruction, and the agent responded that the task was completed. But the user is now showing an error about code parsing. Maybe the \nway I structured the code was incorrect. The user's system might be expecting a different format for the code snippet.                                                                                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \nLet me check the rules again. Oh right, the code must be in a specific format with ```py and end with                                                                                                             \nError in code parsing:\nYour code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern ```(?:py|python)?\\s*\\n(.*?)\\n``` was not found in it.\n```\n\nHere is the full example for more clarity : https://app.warp.dev/block/embed/hUU6K5aEKJKoJZJMpKuPcR\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nPrevent parsing code generation if a ``<think>`` tag appeared without a closing ``</think>`` tag\nAdding a new rule in `fix_final_answer_code` may solve the problem.\nI am willing to contribute if you want.\n","comments":[],"labels":["enhancement"],"created_at":"2025-06-01T20:39:16+00:00","closed_at":null,"patch_url":null,"repo":"huggingface/smolagents","similarity_score":null}

{"id":1381,"state":"open","title":"Manager-Managed Agent Interaction","body":"**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\nCurrently, managed agents are simply treated as standalone tool calls.  A managed agent have no awareness of the code execution history of the agent that called it (the \"manager\"), although a manager agent does have a record of the managed agent's execution history if `provide_run_summary = True`. Neither the manager agent nor the managed agent has access to the objects in the other's `python_executor`. This limits what managed agents are capable of because they do not have access to their manager agents' data (see https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents/issues/1184 for an example). Moreover, a managed agent's memory is reset on each call (athough interestingly, `python_executor` is retained), so if a managed agent is called multiple times, it may need to redo work that it did in a previous call.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n1. Give a managed agent a copy of the calling manager agent's message history, e.g. `manager_agent.write_memory_to_messages()` or some other summary of the manager agent's thoughts and actions. Or maybe even copy the managed agent and set `managed_agent.memory = manager_agent.memory`.\n2. Use the same `python_executor` for both the manager agent and the managed agent.\n3. Give the manager agent a copy of the managed agent's execution history. This is already implemented via `provide_run_summary = True`.\n\nThis should be optional, as there are drawbacks:\n1. This gives the managed agent access to a lot of potentially irrelevant information, possibly degrading it's performance.\n2. Consumes more tokens.\n3. Depending on the implementation, reduces the reusability of a managed agent. Its internal state (e.g. `python_executor`) will be shared with its manager agent, so it would be dangerous to run the managed agent by itself or to assign it to more than one manager agent.\n","comments":[],"labels":["enhancement"],"created_at":"2025-05-24T22:09:32+00:00","closed_at":null,"patch_url":null,"repo":"huggingface/smolagents","similarity_score":null}

{"id":1374,"state":"open","title":"Append step to memory before final_answer_check","body":"**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\nI was trying to use the `final_answer_checks` callback as a way to implement a critic that tells the agent if it can stop. However, I noticed that - at least in the CodeAgent, I haven't tried with ToolCallingAgent yet - the `final_answer_checks` are run prior to the step being appended to `self.memory.step`. That means that the `AgentMemory` object the `final_answer_checks` callable gets does not include the final step. I tried with the following toy example:\n\n```python\nagent = CodeAgent(model='claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219', tools=[], final_answer_checks=[critic_function])\nagent.run(\"What is 1654651 * 6332?\")  # Just to give it a simple task\n```\nThe `AgentMemory` input to `critic_function` only got the `TaskStep` object, even though the agent actually did the right thing with the following code:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the product                                                                                          \nresult = 1654651 * 6332                                                                                       \n                                                                                                                 \n# Return the final answer                                                                                        \nfinal_answer(result)     \n```\n\nSo my critic was left to assume that it just did the arithmetic within the llm and so wants the agent to continue.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nMove the `self.memory.steps.append(action_step)` from the `finally` block in `self._run` to be within the `_execute_step` method. I'd be happy to make a PR for this if you don't foresee it causing any issues. The only issue I could imagine is that \n\n**Is this not possible with the current options.**\nI was able to work around it for now by making a custom agent class:\n\n```python\nclass CustomCodeAgent(CodeAgent):\n    current_step: ActionStep\n\n    def _execute_step(self, task: str, memory_step: ActionStep) -> Union[None, Any]:\n        self.logger.log_rule(f\"Step {self.step_number}\", level=LogLevel.INFO)\n        final_answer = self.step(memory_step)\n        self.current_step = memory_step\n        if final_answer is not None and self.final_answer_checks:\n            self._validate_final_answer(final_answer)\n        return final_answer\n```\n\nand then my critic class used `agent.current_step` to get the extra step it needs.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nIf adding to the memory would cause problems, we could potentially include the current step in the final_answer_checks inputs but that would not be a backwards compatible change and would break everyone's callables that don't currently expect it.\n\nWe could also move the `final_answer_checks` to happen within the `finally` block after the step is added to memory.\n\n**Additional context**\nHere is the relevant code from the current `_run` method:\n\n```python\n            try:\n                # final_answer_checks happen here, but the action_step is not yet in memory\n                # My proposal: put self.memory.steps.append(action_step) here\n                final_answer = self._execute_step(task, action_step)\n            except AgentGenerationError as e:\n                # Agent generation errors are not caused by a Model error but an implementation error: so we should raise them and exit.\n                raise e\n            except AgentError as e:\n                # Other AgentError types are caused by the Model, so we should log them and iterate.\n                action_step.error = e\n            finally:\n                self._finalize_step(action_step, step_start_time)\n                self.memory.steps.append(action_step)\n                # Could also add the final_answer_checks logic here\n                yield action_step\n                self.step_number += 1\n\n```","comments":[],"labels":["enhancement"],"created_at":"2025-05-23T13:50:50+00:00","closed_at":null,"patch_url":null,"repo":"huggingface/smolagents","similarity_score":null}

I am not an expert in SSE but I was a bit confused because for me readable streams and streamingResponse are all what is used for SSE anyway but reading more it seems to be now a mix of regular HTTP calls and SSE and both client and server can initiate, also SSE is not mandatory anymore in which case we end up polling?

This would allow users to select from various models (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, Cohere, etc.) and optimize for cost, latency, or performance as needed.\n\n**Is this not possible with the current options?**\nNo, current integrations do not support OpenRouter or offer a flexible routing layer for using multiple LLMs from different providers in a seamless way. The current API setup is limited to a specific vendor's ecosystem.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\n* Manually routing API calls via a backend server that proxies requests to OpenRouter (adds complexity, overhead).\n* Using different tools for different models (disjointed experience).\n* Maintaining separate billing/accounts per model provider (inefficient and hard to manage at scale).\n\n**Additional context**\nOpenRouter offers a robust and standardized API, usage dashboard, and growing model support.

If so, call the Clarify tool to seek user assistance until the natural language query description is clear and complete enough, and you are sure that you can generate the correct query based on contextual information.\nOnce the problem is sufficiently clear, You should first split the problem into multiple sub-queries corresponding to a table based on the table description and get the field information and sample data through the sample_table_data function to understand the key information such as field meanings. After ensuring that you fully understand the task and have enough information to solve the task, you should follow the sub-queries to generate the sql and get the final result. You must first ensure that the sql can be executed properly and is consistent with the purpose of the original query before you start executing the query task.\nFor the obtained query results, you should first confirm that the results are consistent with the purpose of the query at the beginning, then check if there are any outliers or if the query result is null, and based on the results, decide whether you want to re-query or not, and finally return to the user the final result that you think can correctly match the requirements.\n\n\nBelow is the descriptions of tables in the database.\n[descriptions]\n'''\nUnfortunately, the agent sometimes ask the missing information as the final answer and stop the service before generate a sql query, even not take an attempt. Does anyone know how to control the workflow and force the agent generate a sql query/ select from the database before stop?\nI'd be very appreciate for your help!","comments":[],"labels":[],"created_at":"2025-04-29T08:08:31+00:00","closed_at":"2025-04-29T10:45:18+00:00","patch_url":null,"repo":"huggingface/smolagents","similarity_score":null}

Most of those planned steps __are already known__ from previous messages.\nSo yes, when step 1 is starting, memory is injected and LLM will understand those questions are already answered. But we've done a useless planning in the mean time ...\nCurrently, I am considering deactivating the planning step if it is not a new conversation, due to this behavior.\n\n**Code to reproduce the error**\nYou just need `planning_interval` set and greather than 0.\nThen converse with your agent and do not repeat yourself (e.g. `give me more`) and look at plannings.\n\n**Expected behavior**\nWhen there is a memory, it should be used with the planning.\n\n**Packages version:**\n`v1.13.0`\n\n","comments":[],"labels":["bug"],"created_at":"2025-04-29T08:06:02+00:00","closed_at":null,"patch_url":null,"repo":"huggingface/smolagents","similarity_score":null}

The agent's modified response becomes useless.\n\n**Desired Feature:** We request a mechanism (e.g., a parameter when calling or defining a tool, or a specific agent instruction) that allows us to designate that the raw text output from a particular tool execution should be returned *verbatim* as the final response to the user, bypassing the agent's standard response generation/modification process.\n\n**Analogy:** This functionality is analogous to the `return_direct` feature found in other agent frameworks like LangChain, where a specific step's output is designated as the final, unmodified answer.\n\n**Benefit:** This would enable the effective use of tools that produce output which must be presented precisely as generated, preserving all details and preventing data loss caused by agent summarization or rewriting.\n","comments":[],"labels":["enhancement"],"created_at":"2025-04-23T07:38:38+00:00","closed_at":null,"patch_url":null,"repo":"huggingface/smolagents","similarity_score":null}

The `model` parameter exists but doesn't properly override the default when specified.\n\n2. **Silent Default Fallback**: When no `model_id` is provided, the system silently defaults to `\"anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\"`. This creates confusion when users intend to use other providers like Groq or OpenAI.\n\n3. **Misleading Error Messages**: Users receive authentication errors when using non-Claude API keys with the silently defaulted Claude model. These errors don't indicate that the root cause is incorrect model selection, causing users to waste time debugging what appears to be authentication issues.\n\n4. **Provider Conflicts**: Users can specify `model=\"groq/llama3-8b-8192\"` but still get Claude-related errors.

Either it can be added to the `BASE_PYTHON_TOOLS`\n2. Or there should be a way to override the `BASE_PYTHON_TOOLS` while defining the `CodeAgent`. The same applies to `DANGEROUS_MODULES` and `DANGEROUS_FUNCTIONS` (at the developer's discretion).\n3. Or at least the LLM prompt that generates the Python code should be aware of what built-in function it can and cannot use. This will avoid the use of functions like `open` in the first place.\n\n**Is this not possible with the current options?**\nIt is still possible to define a custom tool to handle the opening of all types of files that the developer wants their agents to support. However since the file content will be part of the memory for the agent, it can cause issues when there is a large file\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nThe same as above.\n\nPlease let me know if I'm missing something obvious here.","comments":[],"labels":["enhancement"],"created_at":"2025-04-10T08:00:42+00:00","closed_at":"2025-04-14T07:24:31+00:00","patch_url":null,"repo":"huggingface/smolagents","similarity_score":null}

Currently, the class only supports passing kwargs to model.generate(), but not to AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained() or similar.\n\nTo work around this, I made a small modification to the codebase that adds support for a model_config dictionary (or similar) to pass these parameters separately.\n\nI’d like to suggest officially supporting this functionality — I believe it would add flexibility for users who need fine-grained control over model loading.\n\nLet me know if this is something you'd be open to — I can even submit a PR with the changes if helpful.\n\nThanks again for your work!\n\n************************************************************************************************************************\nModification in TransformersModel (smolagents/model.py):\n\nclass TransformersModel_v2(Model):\n    \"\"\"\n    A class that uses Hugging Face's Transformers library for language model interaction. \n    ## Now with support to model params and qlora\n\n    This model allows you to load and use Hugging Face's models locally using the Transformers library. It supports features like stop sequences and grammar customization.\n\n    > [!TIP]\n    > You must have `transformers` and `torch` installed on your machine. Please run `pip install smolagents[transformers]` if it's not the case.\n\n    Parameters:\n        model_id (`str`):\n            The Hugging Face model ID to be used for inference. This can be a path or model identifier from the Hugging Face model hub.\n            For example, `\"Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct\"`.\n        device_map (`str`, *optional*):\n            The device_map to initialize your model with.\n        torch_dtype (`str`, *optional*):\n            The torch_dtype to initialize your model with.\n        trust_remote_code (bool, default `False`):\n            Some models on the Hub require running remote code: for this model, you would have to set this flag to True.\n        model_config:\n            Params for model configuration that you want to use in AutoModelForImageTextToText.from_pretrained or AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained\n        kwargs (dict, *optional*):\n            Any additional keyword arguments that you want to use in model.generate(), for instance `max_new_tokens` or `device`.\n        \n    Raises:\n        ValueError:\n            If the model name is not provided.\n\n    Example:\n    ```python\n    >>> engine

{"id":1064,"state":"open","title":"[Feature request] Handoff mode: allow managed agents to respond directly to the user","body":"**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\nOne problem I'm encountering with Smolagents is a scenario like this:\n\n1. I have a primary \"assistant\" CodeAgent which has multiple managed_agents that can perform research. The primary \"assistant\" agent is only tasked with delegating to the correct managed_agent.\n2. A user provides a task, and the CodeAgent correctly delegates to the proper managed_agent, and the managed_agent behaves well and returns a detailed output full of useful information\n3. However, the top-level \"assistant\" agent will not return this detailed information verbatim (unless you ask it too, which is just a huge waste of tokens and time). So those ~200 tokens of great information are getting rephrased by the top-level agent to the user as a sentence.\n\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nAn common pattern with agents is a \"handoff\" where agents select a other agents to perform a task (exactly like managed_agents) but then that other agent can respond directly to the user.\n\nCurrently, we have\n\n```python\nmain_agent = CodeAgent(tools=[], managed_agents=[create_research_agent()], model=model)\n```\n\nI am imagining something like\n\n```python\nmain_agent = CodeAgent(tools=[], handoff_agents=[create_research_agent()], model=model)\n```\n\nFor a user-provided task such as \"when was Elton John born\":\n\n1. the main agent selects the research_agent for handoff\n2. the research_agent performs its steps as usual\n3. when the research_agent provides its final output via `final_answer(...)`, this is shown directly to the user and added as a new message in the top-level conversation with reserach_agent\n\nI suspect there would need to be a new prompt added for this. Because the \"managed_agent\" responding prompt is geared towards \"model to model\" responses, but the user should be able to provide a prompt (or prompt template fragment) to help guide the output.\n\n**Is this not possible with the current options.**\nMake sure to consider if what you're requesting can be done with current abstractions.\nI have gone through some docs and features but haven't found a good way to implement this with current functionality. The best I could come up with was hooking into the `step_callbacks` and manually adjusting the history there, which feels very wrong.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nA clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered.\n\n**Additional context**\nAdd any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.\n","comments":[],"labels":["enhancement"],"created_at":"2025-03-24T05:27:43+00:00","closed_at":null,"patch_url":null,"repo":"huggingface/smolagents","similarity_score":null}

Call `final_answer` tool to return a final answer.\n```\nLooking into the logs, I see entries like\n```py\n'model_output_message': ChatMessage(role='assistant',\n  content=\"Calling tools:\\n[{'id': '...', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'get_state', 'arguments': {}}}]\",\n```\nThe only thing that looks wrong about this, to me, is the prepending of `'Calling tools:\\n'`.\n\nThe first thing I tried was a custom `tool_parser`, as I noticed that `parse_json_tool_call` doesn't handle this prefix.\nHowever, the custom tool parser appears to never get called.\n\nSince the model seems to be learning this format from the chat history, I also tried removing the prefix in `ActionStep.to_messages`, \nthis fixed the extra prefix, but the tool call is still being returned as a string under `ChatMessage(content=`.\n\nI got the same error regardless of whether the function accepts arguments. I am trying tools without args to narrow down the issue. I noticed that the system prompt warns against calling a function multiple times with the same argument, this is not relevant for my use case, so I tried removing that part, but the above issues remain.\n\nI also tried CodeAgent, but it will only succeed if I set `planning_interval`, otherwise the LLM writes an invalid solution and lies about succeeding.\nHowever, if I set `planning_interval`, then ToolCallingAgent is also able to make a correct plan, it just fails to execute it.\n\n**Code to reproduce the error**\nI've seen the exact same issue with multiple models including qwen2.5:7b/14b, qwen2.5-coder:7b/14b, and mistral-nemo:12b\n```py\nmodel = LiteLLMModel(\n    model_id=f\"ollama_chat/qwen2.5:7b\",\n    api_base=\"http://localhost:11434\",\n    num_ctx=32768,\n)\ndef better_tool_parser(text: str):\n    text = text.removeprefix(\"Calling tools:\\n\")\n    print(text)\n    return parse_json_tool_call(text)\nagent = ToolCallingAgent(\n    tools=[...],\n    model=model,\n    tool_parser=better_tool_parser,\n)\nagent.run(prompt)\n```\n\n**Error logs (if any)**\nProvide error logs if there are any.\n\n**Expected behavior**\n- The failed tool call message should be more detailed\n- A model that can call a tool successfully once, should be able to keep calling tools*\n- Changing the formatting of the tool call history shouldn't affect how the model calls tools*\n- tool_parser should warn that it doesn't do anything\n\n*I understand these two might fall under \"LLM is dumb\", but I don't have enough information to determine if the issue is with the model, smolagents, or LiteLLM.\n\n**Packages version:**\n```\nsmolagents==1.10.0\nlitellm==1.63.3\n```\n\n**Additional context**\nI have only tested this with LiteLLM ollama_chat, I don't know if the issue exists with other providers.\n","comments":[],"labels":["bug"],"created_at":"2025-03-11T02:17:28+00:00","closed_at":null,"patch_url":null,"repo":"huggingface/smolagents","similarity_score":null}

{"id":842,"state":"closed","title":"How to pass custom type variables to tools","body":"\nI’m working on a Telegram bot and using the `smolagents` library to create agents that handle reminders. The issue I’m facing is related to passing the `context` object (which is specific to each message received by the bot) to a tool function (`add_reminder`). The `context` object is required to access the `job_queue` for scheduling reminders.\n\n### Problem:\nEven though I’m passing the `context` variable through the `additional_args` argument in `agent.run`, the agent doesn’t seem to pass this variable directly to the code interpreter. Instead, it redefines the variable as `None`, which causes the rest of the code to fail.\n\nHere’s the relevant part of the code:\n\n```python\n@tool\ndef add_reminder(title: str,\n                    date_time: datetime.datetime,\n                    chat_id: str,\n                    context: Any,\n                    location: str = None,\n                    details: str = None) -> dict:\n    \n    '''\n    Add a reminder to the job queue.\n    \n    Args:\n    title: The title of the reminder  (str)\n    date_time: The time for the reminder\n    location: The location of the reminder if it is specified.

This works but is not ideal because I have to redefine the tool every time I want to use it in different agents.\n\nExample:\n\n```python\nasync def add_reminder_from_input(update, context):\n    # Add the reminder\n    input = update.message.text\n    chat_id = update.effective_chat.id\n    now = datetime.datetime.now(tz).strftime(\"%d/%m/%Y %H:%M\")\n    \n    logger.info(f'chat_id: {chat_id}, input: {input}')\n\n    @tool\n    def add_reminder(title: str,\n                        date_time: datetime.datetime,\n                        location: str = None,\n                        details: str = None) -> dict:\n        \n        '''\n        Add a reminder to the job queue.\n        \n        Args:\n        title: The title of the reminder  (str)\n        date_time: The time for the reminder\n        location: The location of the reminder if it is specified.

{"id":841,"state":"open","title":"[BUG] VLM doesn't recognize images in TransformersModel due to processor differences","body":"**Describe the bug**\nI'm unable to get a VLM, specificially HuggingFaceTB/SmolVLM-Instruct, to describe the content of an image due to misalignment between the `processor` usage in Smolagent's `TransformersModel` and the \"intended\" usage of the `processor`. It seems that the `processor` usage in Smolagent's `TransformersModel` may only work for specific VLMs instead of all VLMs.\n\n**Code to reproduce the error**\nFirst, to demonstrate what I would expect as output for a given prompt, I run inference on [HuggingFaceTB/SmolVLM-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceTB/SmolVLM-Instruct) based on the \"How To Get Started\" code.\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport requests\n\nfrom io import BytesIO\nfrom PIL import Image\nfrom transformers import AutoProcessor, AutoModelForVision2Seq\n\nDEVICE = \"cuda\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\"\n\n# Load images\nurl = \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/The_Joker_at_Wax_Museum_Plus.jpg\"\nresponse = requests.get(url)\nimage = Image.open(BytesIO(response.content)).convert(\"RGB\")\n\n# Initialize processor and model.\nprocessor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(\"HuggingFaceTB/SmolVLM-Instruct\")\nmodel = AutoModelForVision2Seq.from_pretrained(\n    \"HuggingFaceTB/SmolVLM-Instruct\",\n    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,\n).to(DEVICE)\n\n# Create input messages\nmessages = [\n    {\n        \"role\": \"user\",\n        \"content\": [\n            {\"type\": \"image\"},\n            {\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Describe the image.\"}\n        ]\n    },\n]\n\n# Prepare inputs.\ninputs = processor.apply_chat_template(messages, add_generation_prompt=True)\ninputs = processor(text=inputs, images=[image], return_tensors=\"pt\")\ninputs = inputs.to(DEVICE)\n\n# Generate outputs.\ngenerated_ids = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=500)\ngenerated_texts = processor.batch_decode(\n    generated_ids,\n    skip_special_tokens=True,\n)\n\nprint(generated_texts[0])\n```\nExecuting this code cell produces the following output:\n```text\nAssistant: The image depicts a person wearing a costume, likely a character from a play or a movie. The person is dressed in a purple suit with a yellow shirt underneath. The costume includes a purple bow tie and a purple jacket. The person's face is painted white, with exaggerated makeup, including dark eyebrows, red lips, and black eyeliner. The person is smiling broadly, with their mouth open and teeth exposed. The background of the image is a plain, light-colored wall, which provides a neutral backdrop for the costume.\n\nThe person's costume is reminiscent of the Joker, a well-known villain from the Batman comic books and movies. The Joker is known for his distinctive appearance, which includes white face paint, dark hair, and a purple suit. The costume in the image closely resembles the Joker's traditional attire, with the purple suit and yellow shirt providing a striking contrast.\n\nThe person's expression is playful and mischievous, suggesting that they are portraying the Joker character. The exaggerated makeup and costume are designed to evoke a sense of comic book villainy, with the exaggerated smile and white face paint adding to the exaggerated appearance.\n\nIn summary, the image depicts a person dressed in a Joker-inspired costume, with a white face, dark eyebrows, red lips, and a purple bow tie. The costume includes a purple suit, yellow shirt, and purple jacket, and the person is smiling broadly. The background is a plain, light-colored wall, which provides a neutral backdrop for the costume. The image is likely taken in a studio or a controlled environment, as the lighting is consistent and there are no other elements that might distract from the costume.\n\nThis description can be used to answer any questions related to the image, such as identifying the character portrayed, the details of the costume, and the overall mood or tone of the image.\n```\nGreat, this looks as something that I'd expect. Now, I try something similar with Smolagent's `TransformersModel` wrapped by the `CodeAgent`.\n\n```python\nfrom smolagents import (\n    TransformersModel,\n    CodeAgent,\n)\n\nmodel = TransformersModel(\n    model_id=\"HuggingFaceTB/SmolVLM-Instruct\", #\"LanguageBind/Video-LLaVA-7B-hf\",   #\"Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct\",  # \"Qwen/Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct\",  # \"Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct\",\n    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,\n    device_map=\"cuda\",\n    max_new_tokens=500,\n)\n\nagent = CodeAgent(\n    model=model,\n    tools=[],\n)\n\nagent.run(\n    \"Describe the image.\",\n    images=[image],\n    max_steps=3,\n)\n```\n\nExecuting this code cell produces the following output:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/672e80a5-ce73-4216-b1c2-b762dcecd7a2)\n\nNote that subsequent steps produce similar outputs.\n\nI dove a bit deeper into the code and it seems that the model is extrapolating based on the default system prompt, which seems to cover similar examples about this 55 year old lumberjack called John Doe (see, e.g., [https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents/blob/main/src/smolagents/prompts/code_agent.yaml#L22-L27](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents/blob/main/src/smolagents/prompts/code_agent.yaml#L22-L27)).\n\nAfter diving deeper, I inspected the [prompt_tensor](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents/blob/main/src/smolagents/models.py#L769) that gets fed into the model. This tensor did not contain the pixel values and its corresponding mask that you'd typically find while working with images in VLMs. Hence, it seems that the processing of the image didn't happen correctly. After further inspection, this seems to be the case due to the misalignment between the `processor` in the `TransformersModel` and what is expected by the model.\n\nIt is expected to be processed as:\n```python\nprompt_tensor = processor.apply_chat_template(messages, add_generation_prompt=True, tools=[...])\nprompt_tensor = processor(text=prompt_tensor, images=[image], return_tensors=\"pt\")\n```\nwhile it gets processed as:\n```python\nimages = [Image.open(image) for image in images] if images else None\nprompt_tensor = self.processor.apply_chat_template(\n    messages,\n    tools=[get_tool_json_schema(tool) for tool in tools_to_call_from] if tools_to_call_from else None,\n    return_tensors=\"pt\",\n    tokenize=True,\n    return_dict=True,\n    images=images,\n    add_generation_prompt=True if tools_to_call_from else False,\n)\n```\nBy modifying how the `processor` is used in the `TransformersModel` (e.g., first apply the chat template on the text and then call the processor on the text and images), I'm able to get a similar response as the one I get when using the model in a standalone manner. However, the generated output is now a textual description of the image without the corresponding Python code blob that we'd expect for the `CodeAgent`.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/91ce03ed-3f1b-40ec-bad4-f8e518a1ab1f)\n\nI have two questions related to the behavior that I observe in this case:\n1. How to make Smolagent's `TransformersModel` compatible with any VLM that may use the `processor` differently from how it is currently implement in Smolagents.\n2. How to further continue my adventure w.r.t. enabling SmolVLM within a `CodeAgent`; specifically, how to get it to generate a Python blob that returns me the description that it is currently already generating.

{"id":805,"state":"open","title":"userinputtool() Prompts Not Displaying in Gradio Interface","body":"**Describe the bug**\nI have developed a solution using SmolAgents that incorporates an agent with multiple tools (Python functions). Specifically, I utilize UserInputTool() to request missing parameters when executing a function. This approach ensures that the agent doesn't fabricate or assume parameters.\n\nHowever, I've encountered an issue where the prompts from UserInputTool() are displayed in the terminal instead of the Gradio interface, this is beacause this tool uses input(). As a result, users interacting with the agent through the Gradio UI cannot see or respond to these prompts, which disrupts the intended user experience.\n\nSource code (https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents/blob/v1.9.2/src/smolagents/default_tools.py):\n```python\nclass UserInputTool(Tool):\n    name = \"user_input\"\n    description = \"Asks for user's input on a specific question\"\n    inputs = {\"question\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The question to ask the user\"}}\n    output_type = \"string\"\n\n    def forward(self, question):\n        user_input = input(f\"{question} => Type your answer here:\")\n        return user_input\n```\n**Code to reproduce the error**\nThe code simplified would be something like this: \n```python\nfrom smolagents import tool, CodeAgent, GradioUI, UserInputTool\n#tools definition\n...\n\nagent = CodeAgent(\n    tools=[check_status_vm, ping_vm, UserInputTool()],\n    model=model,\n    verbosity_level=2,\n    description=\"Solve IT issues with tools. If it needs a missing parameter to execute a tool, it will use UserInputTool to ask the user for it.\",\n    max_steps=6, add_base_tools=True, planning_interval=3\n)\nGradioUI(agent).launch()\n```\n**Expected behavior**\nWhen a function requiring additional parameters is invoked, the UserInputTool() prompts should appear within the Gradio interface.\n\n**Packages version:**\nsmolagents==1.9.2\n\n","comments":[],"labels":["bug"],"created_at":"2025-02-26T12:05:06+00:00","closed_at":null,"patch_url":null,"repo":"huggingface/smolagents","similarity_score":null}

This is not explained anywhere.\n\nThirdly, I couldn't get the \"o1\" model to work with OpenAI. It just kept returning an error that the o1 model was not available. Is it even available for API use for non-pro subscribers?\n\nFourth, you can't use the Open Deep Research example with a non-reasoning model like gpt-4o because it passes in a reasoning_effort parameter that those models don't support. It just doesn't work. I had to edit the run.py code and comment out the line.\n\nFifth, and once you resolve all these issues, you finally think you can ask the agent a question.

{"id":712,"state":"closed","title":"The execution of the action sequence fails when an agent and a tool have the same name","body":"## Problem Description\n+ When the name of the agent handling subtasks is the same as that of a tool, according to the current prompt, the LLM may be confused when choosing whether to use the tool or the agent in the returned action, leading to code execution failure.\n\n## Reproduction Code\n+ Here is a code snippet of `DuckDuckGoSearchTool`:\n    ```py\n        class DuckDuckGoSearchTool(Tool):\n            name = \"web_search\"\n            description = \"\"\"Performs a duckduckgo web search based on your query (think a Google search) then returns the top search results.\"\"\"\n            inputs = {\"query\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The search query to perform.\"}}\n            output_type = \"string\"\n\n            def __init__(self, max_results=10, **kwargs):\n                # 。。。\n    ```\n\n+ As you can see, `DuckDuckGoSearchTool` uses \"web_search\" as its name.\n\n+ Now, let's define and execute the `web_agent`. Note that the name of `web_agent` is also \"web_search\".\n    ```py\n        model_id = \"Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct\"\n        # timeout=120 has issues running this case\n        model = HfApiModel(model_id=model_id, token=\"XXXXX\",timeout=360)\n        web_agent = ToolCallingAgent(\n            tools=[DuckDuckGoSearchTool(), visit_webpage],\n            model=model,\n            max_steps=10,\n            name=\"web_search\", #\n            description=\"Runs web searches for you. Give it your query as an argument.\",\n        )\n\n        manager_agent = CodeAgent(\n            tools=[],\n            model=model,\n            managed_agents=[web_agent],\n            additional_authorized_imports=[\"time\", \"numpy\", \"pandas\"],\n        )\n        result = manager_agent.run(\"If LLM training continues to scale up at the current rhythm until 2030, what would be the electric power in GW required to power the biggest training runs by 2030? What would that correspond to, compared to some countries? Please provide a source for any numbers used.\")\n        print(result)\n    ```\n\n+ Let's start executing the code. When the first step is executed, the code sequence returned by the LLM is as follows:\n    ```log\n    ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ Step 1 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n    ─ Executing parsed code: ───────────────────────────────────────────────────── \n    power_consumption_info = web_search(query=\"LLM training power consumption     \n    and scaling rates\")                                                           \n    print(power_consumption_info)                                                 \n    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── \n    Code execution failed at line 'power_consumption_info = web_search(query=\"LLM \n    training power consumption and scaling rates\")' due to: TypeError: \n    MultiStepAgent.__call__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'task'\n    [Step 1: Duration 24.54 seconds| Input tokens: 2,171 | Output tokens: 128]\n    ```\n\n+ Obviously, during the thinking process, the LLM preferentially selects the \"web_search\" from the tool to generate the code sequence. However, when the Python interpreter executes this code, it actually hits the `__call__` method of the `manager_agent`. Therefore, it notice that the `task` parameter is required instead of the `query` parameter, which causes confusion.\n\n+ I have currently thought of two solutions, but I'm not sure if they are the optimal ones. I hope to discuss them with the developers.\n\n+ The first solution is to check for duplicate names between `managed_agents` and `tools` when initializing the agent and throw an error for duplicate names. Here is the pseudocode:\n```py\nclass MultiStepAgent:\n    def __init__(\n        self,\n        tools: List[Tool],\n        model: Callable[[List[Dict[str, str]]], ChatMessage],\n        prompt_templates: Optional[PromptTemplates] = None,\n        max_steps: int = 6,\n        tool_parser: Optional[Callable] = None,\n        add_base_tools: bool = False,\n        verbosity_level: LogLevel = LogLevel.INFO,\n        grammar: Optional[Dict[str, str]] = None,\n        managed_agents: Optional[List] = None,\n        step_callbacks: Optional[List[Callable]] = None,\n        planning_interval: Optional[int] = None,\n        name: Optional[str] = None,\n        description: Optional[str] = None,\n        provide_run_summary: bool = False,\n        final_answer_checks: Optional[List[Callable]] = None,\n    ):\n\n        self.managed_agents = {}\n        if managed_agents is not None:\n            for managed_agent in managed_agents:\n                assert managed_agent.name and managed_agent.description, (\n                    \"All managed agents need both a name and a description!\"\n                )\n            self.managed_agents = {agent.name: agent for agent in managed_agents}\n\n        for tool in tools:\n            assert isinstance(tool, Tool), f\"This element is not of class Tool: {str(tool)}\"\n        self.tools = {tool.name: tool for tool in tools}\n        if add_base_tools:\n            for tool_name, tool_class in TOOL_MAPPING.items():\n                if tool_name != \"python_interpreter\" or self.__class__.__name__ == \"ToolCallingAgent\":\n                    self.tools[tool_name] = tool_class()\n        self.tools[\"final_answer\"] = FinalAnswerTool()\n\n        duplicate_name_check_between(self.managed_agents,self.tools)\n        ...\n\n    def duplicate_name_check_between(self.managed_agents,self.tools)\n        agent_names = set()\n        for agent in self.managed_agents:\n            agent_names.add(agent.get('name'))\n\n        for tool in self.tools:\n            tool_name = tool.get('name')\n            if tool_name in agent_names:\n                raise ValueError(f\"Found duplicate name: {tool_name}\")\n        return False\n```\n\n+ The second solution is to modify the prompt by adding something like `If there are an agent and a tool with the same name, you should give priority to invoking the agent. The following is an example of this situation.` and then supplement the above in - situ code as a case.\n\n+ Looking forward to your replies.","comments":[],"labels":[],"created_at":"2025-02-19T14:21:00+00:00","closed_at":"2025-02-20T14:55:48+00:00","patch_url":null,"repo":"huggingface/smolagents","similarity_score":null}

{"id":685,"state":"open","title":"Python logging missing console output (solved: workaround with Rich)","body":"### Description:\nI ran into an issue while trying to capture console output into a log.log file for manual inspection. I initially assumed that interfacing with the Python logging module in the library would be sufficient, but I noticed that most of the console output—particularly the \"thinking\" process—was missing from my logs. Only a few API calls and minimal details were being logged.\n\nAfter investigating, I realized that most of the console output is handled by Rich (monitoring.py) rather than the standard logging module. As a result, simply configuring logging didn’t capture all the relevant information.\n\n### Workaround: Dual Console Logging with Rich\nTo solve this, you can create a dual-output system using Rich’s Console class. This setup allows logging to both log.log and the terminal while maintaining proper formatting. I needed this solution because I'm still getting familiar with LLM/agentic frameworks and am not yet ready to dive into an observability platform. Just needed a simple way to test things.\n\nHere is a full working script for reference (simple web search agent writing to both console and log.log file):\n\n```python\nfrom smolagents import HfApiModel, LiteLLMModel, TransformersModel, DuckDuckGoSearchTool\nfrom smolagents.agents import CodeAgent\nfrom smolagents.monitoring import LogLevel\nfrom rich.console import Console\n\navailable_inferences = [\"hf_api\", \"transformers\", \"ollama\", \"litellm\"]\nchosen_inference = \"litellm\"\n\nprint(f\"Chose model: '{chosen_inference}'\")\n\nif chosen_inference == \"hf_api\":\n    model = HfApiModel(model_id=\"meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct\")\nelif chosen_inference == \"transformers\":\n    model = TransformersModel(\n        model_id=\"HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-1.7B-Instruct\",\n        device_map=\"auto\",\n        max_new_tokens=1000,\n    )\nelif chosen_inference == \"ollama\":\n    model = LiteLLMModel(\n        model_id=\"ollama_chat/llama3.2\",\n        api_base=\"http://localhost:11434\",\n        api_key=\"your-api-key\",\n        num_ctx=8192,\n    )\nelif chosen_inference == \"litellm\":\n    model = LiteLLMModel(model_id=\"gpt-4o-mini\")\n\n\n# Create dual console that writes to both file and stdout\nclass DualConsole:\n    def __init__(self, filename):\n        self.file_console = Console(\n            file=open(filename, \"a\", encoding=\"utf-8\", errors=\"replace\"),\n            force_terminal=False,  # Disable terminal sequences for file\n            width=120,  # Wider width for file output\n        )\n        # Keep terminal console with default settings\n        self.std_console = Console()\n\n    def print(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        try:\n            self.file_console.print(*args, **kwargs, highlight=False)\n            self.std_console.print(*args, **kwargs)\n        except UnicodeEncodeError as e:\n            error_msg = f\"Unicode handling error: {str(e)}\"\n            self.file_console.print(error_msg, style=\"bold red\")\n            self.std_console.print(error_msg, style=\"bold red\")\n\n\n# Initialize dual console before creating agent\ndual_console = DualConsole(\"log.log\")\n\n# Initialize CodeAgent with DuckDuckGo search capability\nagent = CodeAgent(\n    tools=[DuckDuckGoSearchTool()],  # Web search tool for research\n    model=model,\n    add_base_tools=True, \n    verbosity_level=LogLevel.DEBUG,\n)\n\n# Override agent's console with our dual logger\nagent.logger.console = dual_console\nagent.monitor.logger.console = dual_console  # Also update monitor's console\n\n\nprint(\n    \"Research Results:\",\n    agent.run(\n        \"What are the latest developments in humanoid robot technology as of early 2025? \"\n        \"Find and summarize three key advancements from reliable sources.\"\n    ),\n)\n\n```","comments":[],"labels":[],"created_at":"2025-02-17T17:25:19+00:00","closed_at":null,"patch_url":null,"repo":"huggingface/smolagents","similarity_score":null}

{"id":574,"state":"open","title":"Allow for introspection and type hints over class attributes when defining tool classes","body":"**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\n\nI love smolagents, but defining my own tools as classes feels clunky\n\nCurrently when using classes over functions, class definitions are not very idiomatic python, e.g.\n\n```python\nclass HFModelDownloadsTool(Tool):\n    name = \"model_download_counter\"\n    description = \"\"\"\n    This is a tool that returns the most downloaded model of a given task on the Hugging Face Hub.\n    It returns the name of the checkpoint.\"\"\"\n    inputs = {\n        \"task\": {\n            \"type\": \"string\",\n            \"description\": \"the task category (such as text-classification, depth-estimation, etc)\",\n        }\n    }\n    output_type = \"string\"\n\n    def forward(self, task: str):\n        from huggingface_hub import list_models\n\n        model = next(iter(list_models(filter=task, sort=\"downloads\", direction=-1)))\n        return model.id\n```\n\nall of the 4 required class attributes could instead be introspected from docstrings and type hints (as they are when using tool function decorators).\n\nAdditionally, the example is confusing, because it looks like there is some introspection of the `forward` happening method:\n\nhttps://github.com/huggingface/smolagents/blob/d74837b10a4e2bc51105cce9b81f21b64dde55ac/src/smolagents/tools.py#L149-L157\n\nbut it's not really clear how that relates to the class attributes, if one takes precedence over the other, particularly the (less expressive) type in `output_type`. It also looks like it's possible to have contradictory type hints and class attributes, and it's not clear what the overall effect is on prompt generation and result interpretation.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nMore idiomatic python would look like:\n\n```python\nclass HFModelDownloadsTool(Tool):\n    \"\"\"\n    This is a tool that returns the most downloaded model of a given task on the Hugging Face Hub.\n    It returns the name of the checkpoint.\"\"\"\n\n    def forward(self, task: str) -> string:\n        \"\"\"\n        Args:\n          task: the task category (such as text-classification, depth-estimation, etc)\n        Returns:\n           name of the checkpoint\n        \"\"\"\n        from huggingface_hub import list_models\n\n        model = next(iter(list_models(filter=task, sort=\"downloads\", direction=-1)))\n        return model.id\n```\n\nI could try a PR for this but I don't know where this fits on your roadmap\n\n**Is this not possible with the current options.**\n\nAs an interim step it would be good to have more docs here that explain best practice:\n\nhttps://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/tutorials/tools\n\nIn particular this isn't clear:\n\n> An output_type attribute, which specifies the output type. The types for both inputs and output_type should be [Pydantic formats](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/json_schema/#generating-json-schema), they can be either of these: ~AUTHORIZED_TYPES().\n\nThe pydantic docs are for generating json schema, and it looks like the `~AUTHORIZED_TYPES()` is meant to auto-expand.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\nAn alternative would be to encourage use of decorated functions, but to add a `context` argument, similar to pydantic-ai, which would bypass the current limitations of this (simpler) approach\n\nhttps://ai.pydantic.dev/#tools-dependency-injection-example\n\n","comments":[],"labels":["enhancement"],"created_at":"2025-02-09T22:38:13+00:00","closed_at":null,"patch_url":null,"repo":"huggingface/smolagents","similarity_score":null}

This defeats the purpose of tools and prevents reliable execution in workflows requiring large text processing.\nSteps to Reproduce\n\n    Define a Tool (e.g., SummarizationTool) that accepts long text and chunks it internally.\n    Register the Tool with CodeAgent.\n    Send a large text input via agent.run(prompt).\n    Observe the Issue:\n        The input never reaches the tool in full.\n        Instead, CodeAgent processes it first, truncating it to its own model’s context length.\n        The remaining truncated input is then passed to the tool, defeating the purpose of handling long text.\n\nExpected Behavior\n\n    CodeAgent should immediately pass the input to SummarizationTool, without truncating it or attempting to reason about it first.\n\nObserved Behavior\n\n    CodeAgent processes the input first, leading to truncation.\n    Even if the tool is the only valid choice for execution, the agent still tries to analyze the text before passing it.\n    The tool only receives partially processed, truncated input instead of the full text.\n\nProposed Fixes\n\n    Honor System Prompt Rules\n        If the system prompt explicitly states:\n\n            \"For any summarization task, immediately use the summarization_tool without processing the input first.\"\n            The agent must respect this directive.\n\n    Provide a Direct Tool Execution Mode\n        If the user specifies a tool explicitly in the request:\n\n        {\n          \"tool\": \"summarization_tool\",\n          \"args\": { \"text\": \"Very long text...\" }\n        }\n\n        The agent should not attempt intermediate processing.\n\n    Modify CodeAgent to Respect Token Limits at the Tool Level\n        If an input exceeds the agent’s context limit, the agent should pass it to the tool immediately instead of trying to process it first.\n\nWorkaround (Not Ideal)\n\nUsers currently have to bypass SmolAgents completely and call the tool manually:\n\nsummary = SummarizationTool().forward(long_text)\n\nThis makes SmolAgents useless for tool orchestration in cases requiring large text handling.\nImpact\n\n    Critical usability issue for any tool requiring large input (summarization, document parsing, data extraction, etc.).\n    Prevents SmolAgents from handling real-world workloads where LLM context limits are a known constraint.\n\nReproducible Code\n\nfrom smolagents import CodeAgent, LiteLLMModel\nfrom summarization_tool import SummarizationTool  # Custom tool\n\nagent = CodeAgent(\n    tools=[SummarizationTool()],\n    model=LiteLLMModel(model_id=\"openai/gpt-4o\"),\n    system_prompt=\"Always use summarization_tool for large text. Do not process text yourself.\"\n)\n\nlong_text = \"...\"  # Large document exceeding LLM context limit\n\nresponse = agent.run(f\"Summarize this:\\n{long_text}\")\nprint(response)  # 🔴 Receives truncated text, tool never sees full input\n\nPriority: HIGH\n\nThis blocks any real-world usage of tools that are supposed to handle large input. If SmolAgents cannot be trusted to delegate correctly, it cannot be used in production.\nRequest\n\n🚀 Please fix this by ensuring CodeAgent does not process input that is meant for a tool before calling the tool.\n\nI've include a GIST of the code here: https://gist.github.com/grahama1970/12e4051997f8988bfdd56796436a6cae\n\nMuch appreciation in advance","comments":[],"labels":["bug"],"created_at":"2025-02-06T23:43:47+00:00","closed_at":null,"patch_url":null,"repo":"huggingface/smolagents","similarity_score":null}

The `llama.cpp` framework offers an efficient and optimized way to run large language models with reduced resource consumption, making it an attractive option for developers and researchers.\n\n**Current Challenges:**\n- **Limited Model Support:** While **smolagents** currently supports models like those from Hugging Face's Transformers library, there's a growing demand for integrating models managed by `llama.cpp`.\n- **Performance Optimization:** `llama.cpp` provides optimized performance for running large language models on resource-constrained environments, which is beneficial for users who require high efficiency without compromising on model capabilities.\n\n**Proposed Solution:**\nIntroduce a new `LlamaCppModel` class that seamlessly integrates `llama.cpp` models into the **smolagents** ecosystem, ensuring proper parameter handling and conditional tool usage.\n\n### **Detailed Description**\n\nThe `LlamaCppModel` class is designed to interact with `llama.cpp` models, providing robust parameter management and the ability to utilize tools only when explicitly provided. This integration ensures that users can leverage the efficiency of `llama.cpp` while maintaining the flexibility and functionality that **smolagents** offers.\n\n**Key Features:**\n- **Flexible Model Loading:** Supports loading models from a local path or directly from a Hugging Face repository.\n- **Parameter Management:** Allows customization of GPU layers, context size, and maximum token generation.\n- **Conditional Tool Integration:** Integrates tools seamlessly when they are passed, ensuring optimized performance.","comments":[],"labels":["enhancement"],"created_at":"2025-01-31T12:54:13+00:00","closed_at":null,"patch_url":null,"repo":"huggingface/smolagents","similarity_score":null}

The user's previous attempts resulted in several errors related to the API they were using, specifically mentioning Deepseek's requirements about message formats. The main error seems to be that the last message in the conversation must be a user message or an assistant message with prefix mode enabled. \\n\\nFirst, I need to understand the problem. The agent was probably trying to use the Deepseek API but didn't structure the messages correctly. The errors indicate that the API expects the last message to be from the user, or if it's an assistant message, prefix mode should be on. Since the agent kept getting the same error, maybe they were sending an assistant message as the last one without the proper prefix.\\n\\nSo, to fix this, I should structure the API request according to Deepseek's guidelines. That means ensuring the last message is from the user. Alternatively, if the assistant needs to send a message, they should enable prefix mode. But since the task is to get the weather, which requires external data, the assistant might not have real-time access. Therefore, the correct approach would be to inform the user that real-time weather data isn't accessible and suggest checking a reliable source or using a weather service. \\n\\nWait, but maybe the initial agent tried to generate a weather report directly, leading to API errors because it's not a function they can perform. The repeated 400 errors suggest the message format was wrong, but after several retries, the max steps were reached. So, the solution is to acknowledge the inability to fetch real-time data and guide the user to appropriate resources. That way, the response complies with the API's message structure by ending with a user message or properly formatted assistant response.\"}}], \"created\": 1738237298, \"model\": \"deepseek-reasoner\", \"object\": \"chat.completion\", \"service_tier\": null, \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_7e73fd9a08\", \"usage\": {\"completion_tokens\": 524, \"prompt_tokens\": 1482, \"total_tokens\": 2006, \"completion_tokens_details\": {\"accepted_prediction_tokens\": null, \"audio_tokens\": null, \"reasoning_tokens\": 359, \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": null}, \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\"audio_tokens\": null, \"cached_tokens\": 0}, \"prompt_cache_hit_tokens\": 0, \"prompt_cache_miss_tokens\": 1482}}\n\n\nFinal answer: I don't have real-time weather data access, but here's how to get the current Dublin weather:\n\n1. **Search Engine**: Try \"Dublin weather\" on Google/Bing for instant forecasts\n2. **Weather Services**: Use dedicated platforms like:\n   - AccuWeather: [https://www.accuweather.com](https://www.accuweather.com)\n   - BBC Weather: [https://www.bbc.co.uk/weather](https://www.bbc.co.uk/weather)\n3. **Mobile Apps**: Check default weather apps or install reputable ones like Weather Underground\n\nThis error occurred because I'm an AI text model without live internet access.

Clearly smolagents can do [multi-agent orchestration](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/en/examples/multiagents). However, it's not obvious to me if smolagents supports explicit agent routing. I.e., instead of some \"manager\" or autonomous system deciding what agent or tool is called next, I want to be able to define a precise workflow akin to Langgraph ([for example](https://ai.gopubby.com/building-rag-research-multi-agent-with-langgraph-1bd47acac69f)). Is this currently possible in smolagents, and if not, is there an appetite to implement this feature? I would be happy to dig into it.\n\nEdit: now that I think of it, I think that once #316 is merged, this will be more straightforward to implement too. Once an agent is \"done\" it could simply pass its task list to another agent? All that we'd need is a pattern for that design (perhaps similar to LangGraph).

However this seems not to work with an agent that uses multiple manged_agents.\n\n### Example Scenario:\nThe `metadata_retriever_agent` uses the `retrieve_metadata` tool, which requires a dedicated retriever argument to perform its operations. Below is a code snippet illustrating the setup:\n\n```\n@tool\ndef retrieve_metadata(query: str, retriever: RepoRetriever) -> dict:\n    \"\"\"\n    This tool can be used to retrieve metadata.\n\n    Args:\n        query: The query string to search for.\n        retriever: An instance of the RepoRetriever class.\n    \"\"\"\n    return retriever.query_repos(query)\n\nmetadata_retriever_agent = CodeAgent(\n    tools=[retrieve_metadata, format_metadata_results],\n    model=llm, \n    additional_authorized_imports=[\"asyncio\"],\n    )\n\n# Make managed agents that will be used by the manager agent\nmanaged_metadata_agent = ManagedAgent(\n    agent=metadata_retriever_agent,\n    name=\"metadata_retriever\",\n    description=\"Retrieves metadata from different repositories and outputs the top-5 results.\"\n)\n\nmanager_agent = CodeAgent(\n    tools=[],\n    model=llm,\n    managed_agents=[managed_metadata_agent],\n    )\n\ndef call_agent(query: str, retriever: RepoRetriever) -> str:\n    return manager_agent.run(query,\n                             additional_args={\"retriever\": retriever})\n\n```\n### Problem:\nThe `retrieve_metadata` tool within the `metadata_retriever_agent` requires a retriever argument. However, it’s unclear how to pass this argument effectively in the current multi-agent system, especially when the tool is encapsulated within a managed agent.\n\n### Question:\nWhat is the best practice for passing required arguments (like retriever) to tools in such a system?

This can lead to poor memory usage (at best) if y is large, and incorrect behavior if the object defines `__iadd__` in unusual ways.\n\nFor example, the [pulp](https://pypi.org/project/PuLP/) module for mixed linear integer programming defines an \"LpProblem\" object, which overrides `__iadd__` as a convenience to simplify the syntax of adding constraints and setting objectives:\n\n```\nproblem += max_val   # set optimization objective\nproblem += x+y < 10  # add constraint\n\n```\n\nThe python local interpreter interprets the first line as `problem = problem + max_val`, but LpProblem doesn't implement an `__add__` method, so this results in an exception.

Traceback**\r\nThe error originates from the `step` function in `agents.py` within the `ToolCallingAgent` class:  \r\n```python\r\ntry:\r\n    model_message = self.model(\r\n        self.input_messages,\r\n        tools_to_call_from=list(self.tools.values()),\r\n        stop_sequences=[\"Observation:\"],\r\n    )\r\n    tool_calls = model_message.tool_calls[0]\r\n    tool_arguments = tool_calls.function.arguments\r\n    tool_name, tool_call_id = tool_calls.function.name, tool_calls.id\r\n\r\nexcept Exception as e:\r\n    raise AgentGenerationError(\r\n        f\"Error in generating tool call with model:\\n{e}\"\r\n    )\r\n```\r\nThe `tool_calls` list is empty because the `vllm` service returns the `tool_call` data as a string within `model_message.content` instead of populating `model_message.tool_calls`.  \r\n\r\n**Examples of `model_message` values returned by different models:**\r\n- **Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct:**\r\n  ```python\r\n  ChatCompletionMessage(\r\n      content='Action:\\n{\\n  \"tool_name\": \"get_weather\",\\n  \"tool_arguments\": {\"location\": \"Paris\", \"celsius\": true}\\n}',\r\n      refusal=None,\r\n      role='assistant',\r\n      audio=None,\r\n      function_call=None,\r\n      tool_calls=[]\r\n  )\r\n  ```\r\n- **Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct:**\r\n  ```python\r\n  ChatCompletionMessage(\r\n      content='Action:\\n{\\n  \"tool_name\": \"get_weather\",\\n  \"tool_arguments\": {\\n    \"location\": \"Paris\",\\n    \"celsius\": true\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nThis action will get the weather information for Paris, and I will use the result as the final answer.',\r\n      refusal=None,\r\n      role='assistant',\r\n      audio=None,\r\n      function_call=None,\r\n      tool_calls=[]\r\n  )\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n#### **5. Temporary Fix**\r\nA possible workaround is to modify the `step` function to parse `tool_calls` from `model_message.content` when `model_message.tool_calls` is empty:\r\n```python\r\ntry:\r\n    model_message = self.model(\r\n        self.input_messages,\r\n        tools_to_call_from=list(self.tools.values()),\r\n        stop_sequences=[\"Observation:\"],\r\n    )\r\n    # Extract tool call from model output\r\n    if type(model_message.tool_calls) is list and len(model_message.tool_calls) > 0:\r\n        tool_calls = model_message.tool_calls[0]\r\n        tool_arguments = tool_calls.function.arguments\r\n        tool_name, tool_call_id = tool_calls.function.name, tool_calls.id\r\n    else:\r\n        start, end = model_message.content.find('{'), model_message.content.rfind('}') + 1\r\n        tool_calls = json.loads(model_message.content[start:end])\r\n        tool_arguments = tool_calls[\"tool_arguments\"]\r\n        tool_name, tool_call_id = tool_calls[\"tool_name\"], f\"call_{len(self.logs)}\"\r\n\r\nexcept Exception as e:\r\n    raise AgentGenerationError(\r\n        f\"Error in generating tool call with model:\\n{e}\"\r\n    )\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this bug-fix, the script executes normally:\r\n```plaintext\r\n╭────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── New run ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮\r\n│                                                                                                                                                                                                      │\r\n│ What's the weather like in Paris?                                                                                                                                                                    │\r\n│                                                                                                                                                                                                      │\r\n╰─ OpenAIServerModel - model ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯\r\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ Step 0 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\r\n╭──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮\r\n│ Calling tool: 'get_weather' with arguments: {'location': 'Paris', 'celsius': True}                                                                                                                   │\r\n╰──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯\r\nObservations: The weather is UNGODLY with torrential rains and temperatures below -10°C\r\n[Step 0: Duration 298.02 seconds| Input tokens: 947 | Output tokens: 57]\r\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ Step 1 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\r\n╭──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮\r\n│ Calling tool: 'final_answer' with arguments: The weather is UNGODLY with torrential rains and temperatures below -10°C                                                                               │\r\n╰──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯\r\nFinal answer: The weather is UNGODLY with torrential rains and temperatures below -10°C\r\n[Step 1: Duration 7.64 seconds| Input tokens: 1,972 | Output tokens: 95]\r\nThe weather is UNGODLY with torrential rains and temperatures below -10°C\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### **6.

I would like to request the addition of an option to use `device_map=\"auto\"` to enable the utilization of multiple GPUs.\r\n\r\n## 2. Problem Description\r\n1. **Limited GPU Utilization**: With the current implementation, smolagents can only make use of a single CUDA device. This is a significant limitation, especially when dealing with large models that could benefit from parallel processing across multiple GPUs. For example, running a large language model for text generation tasks would be much faster if multiple GPUs could be used.\r\n2. **Lack of Scalability**: As the size of models and the complexity of tasks grow, the ability to scale by using multiple GPUs becomes crucial. The current `.to(device)` method does not provide this scalability.\r\n\r\nThere is the error I meet. Although I have many cudas, it only work on cuda:0.\r\n```bash\r\nOutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 384.00 MiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 23.65 GiB of which 14.06 MiB is free. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 23.63 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 23.12 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 60.91 MiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.  See documentation for Memory Management  (https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/cuda.html#environment-variables)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 3. Proposed Solution\r\n1. **Add `device_map=\"auto\"` Option**: In the `TransformersModel` class, when initializing the model, add an option to use `device_map=\"auto\"` instead of just `.to(device)`. This would allow the model to automatically distribute across available GPUs, optimizing performance. For example, the code could be updated as follows:\r\n```python\r\ntry:\r\n    self.model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, device_map=\"auto\")\r\nexcept Exception as e:\r\n    # Handle the exception as before\r\n    pass\r\n```\r\n2. **Configuration for Users**: Provide a way for users to easily configure this option. This could be through a configuration file or an additional parameter when initializing the relevant classes in smolagents.\r\n\r\n## 4. Benefits\r\n1. **Performance Improvement**: Using multiple GPUs will significantly improve the inference speed of the models in smolagents. This will lead to faster response times, especially for computationally intensive tasks.\r\n2. **Scalability**: It will make smolagents more suitable for large - scale projects and research, where the ability to scale the computing resources is essential.\r\n\r\nThank you for considering this feature request. I believe it will greatly enhance the capabilities of smolagents.

{"id":100,"state":"closed","title":"Importing smolagents Takes Excessive Time","body":"\r\n### Bug Report: Importing `smolagents` Takes Excessive Time\r\n\r\n#### **Description**\r\nImporting the `smolagents` module takes an unusually long time, which affects usability, especially for non-transformer-related tools. The long import time seems to be caused by the initialization of heavy dependencies like `transformers` and `torch`, even when they are not required for certain tools.\r\n\r\n#### **Steps to Reproduce**\r\nRun the following script to benchmark the import time:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport time\r\n\r\nstart_time = time.time()\r\nimport smolagents\r\nfrom smolagents import CodeAgent, DuckDuckGoSearchTool, HfApiModel\r\nend_time = time.time() - start_time\r\nprint(f\"smolagents import time: {end_time:.2f} seconds\")\r\nprint(\"smolagents version:\", smolagents.__version__)\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### **Observed Behavior**\r\n```log\r\nsmolagents import time: 9.52 seconds\r\nsmolagents version: 1.1.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### **Expected Behavior**\r\nThe `smolagents` module should import significantly faster, especially when non-transformer-related tools (e.g., `DuckDuckGoSearchTool`) are being used. The framework should avoid loading unnecessary dependencies during import or should defer their initialization using lazy loading.\r\n\r\n#### **Possible Cause**\r\nThe long import time appears to be due to the initialization of dependencies like:\r\n- `transformers`\r\n- `torch`\r\n\r\nThese dependencies are loaded even when they are not required for certain tools or agents. As an agent framework, `smolagents` should minimize the overhead of importing the module by:\r\n1. Not loading dependencies unrelated to the tools in use.\r\n2. Implementing lazy loading for modules like `transformers` and `torch`.\r\n\r\n#### **Environment**\r\n- `smolagents` version: 1.1.0\r\n- Python version: 3.12\r\n- Operating System: macOS/Linux/Windows \r\n\r\n#### **Proposed Solution**\r\n- Implement lazy loading for dependencies like `transformers` and `torch`.\r\n- Optimize the import path to avoid initializing unrelated components when using non-transformer-related tools.\r\n\r\n#### **Impact**\r\nThe high import time reduces the performance and efficiency of the framework, especially in scenarios where only lightweight tools like `DuckDuckGoSearchTool` are required.\r\n\r\n#### **Additional Context**\r\nThis issue significantly impacts workflows where `smolagents` is used as a lightweight agent framework for tools that do not require deep learning components.\r\n","comments":[],"labels":[],"created_at":"2025-01-07T09:00:41+00:00","closed_at":"2025-01-14T18:41:46+00:00","patch_url":null,"repo":"huggingface/smolagents","similarity_score":null}

I would like to clarify how to resolve these errors.\r\n\r\nHeres the final answer:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[Step 5: Duration 10.72 seconds| Input tokens: 31,633 | Output tokens: 3,122]\r\nReached max steps.\r\nFinal answer: To answer the user's request, we first need to estimate the growth rate of LLM trainings and then calculate the electric power required to power the biggest training runs by 2030. Let's \r\nfetch the current growth rate of LLM training.\r\n\r\nCurrent growth rate of LLM training: \"15% increased in 2021 year-over-year\" (source: <https://www.statista.com/statistics/1184251/growth-rate-us-ai-hardware-usage/>)\r\n\r\nTaking this year-over-year growth rate into account, we can estimate the power consumption growth factor for the period from 2022 to 2030:\r\n\r\n* Growth rate % = 15% = 0.15\r\n* Number of years = 8 (2030 - 2022)\r\n* Power consumption growth factor = (1 + 0.15)**8 ≈ 2.1657\r\n\r\nLet's find the max electrical power consumption for the biggest training runs of LLM in 2022, assuming each training run requires 0.1 GW, in total, 10 such training runs are needed:\r\n\r\n* Max electrical power consumption in 2022 = 0.1 GW x 10 = 1 GW\r\n\r\nFinally, we can estimate the electric power required to power the biggest training runs by 2030:\r\n\r\n* Power consumption in 2030 = 1 GW x 2.1657 ≈ 2.166 GW\r\n\r\nNow, let's compare this estimated power consumption with some countries. We will consider countries' electricity consumption per capita in 2022 (source:\r\n<https://www.indexmundi.com/energy.aspx?country=USA&year=2022&month=12&param=ec>):\r\n\r\n* USA: Electricity consumption per capita in 2022 = 305 kWh/day ≈ 109 GW (source: <https://www.indexmundi.com/energy.aspx?country=USA&year=2022&month=12&param=ec>)\r\n* China: Electricity consumption per capita in 2022 = 4185 kWh/day ≈ 1.47 TW (source: <https://www.indexmundi.com/energy.aspx?country=CHN&year=2022&month=12&param=ec>)\r\n* India: Electricity consumption per capita in 2022 = 834 kWh/day ≈ 30.2 GW (source: <https://www.indexmundi.com/energy.aspx?country=IND&year=2022&month=12&param=ec>)\r\n* Japan: Electricity consumption per capita in 2022 = 6193 kWh/day ≈ 2.2 TW (source: <https://www.indexmundi.com/energy.aspx?country=JPN&year=2022&month=12&param=ec>)\r\n* Germany: Electricity consumption per capita in 2022 = 6148 kWh/day ≈ 2.18 TW (source: <https://www.indexmundi.com/energy.aspx?country=DEU&year=2022&month=12&param=ec>)\r\n\r\nNow, let's compare the estimated power consumption for the biggest training runs in 2030 to the electricity consumption per capita of the mentioned countries:\r\n\r\n* Comparison to USA: 2.166 GW / 109 GW = 20.2x\r\n* Comparison to China: 2.166 GW / 1.47 TW ≈ 0.15x\r\n* Comparison to India: 2.166 GW / 30.2 GW = 71.7x\r\n* Comparison to Japan: 2.166 GW / 2.2 TW ≈ 0.1 x\r\n* Comparison to Germany: 2.166 GW / 2.18 TW = 1x\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the estimated power consumption for the biggest training runs in 2030 is almost the same as the total electricity consumption of Germany and close to the electricity consumption per\r\ncapita of India. It's worth noting that the 2.166 GW estimate is for the power consumption of the biggest training runs of a large language model, whereas the comparison has been made with the\r\nelectricity consumption per capita figures of the mentioned countries.\r\n```\r\n","comments":[],"labels":[],"created_at":"2025-01-07T02:35:04+00:00","closed_at":"2025-01-09T22:44:05+00:00","patch_url":null,"repo":"huggingface/smolagents","similarity_score":null}

Here is a basic script that passes in a lambda that calls `os.remove()`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport os\r\nimport tempfile\r\n\r\nfrom smolagents.local_python_executor import LocalPythonInterpreter\r\n\r\ndef test_lambda_closure():\r\n    # Create interpreter with no extra imports or tools\r\n    interpreter = LocalPythonInterpreter(additional_authorized_imports=[], tools={})\r\n    \r\n    # Try to pass in a lambda that uses os\r\n    test_file = \"./test.txt\"\r\n    \r\n        # Create temporary file in a safe location\r\n    with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(mode='w', delete=False) as f:\r\n            test_file = f.name\r\n            f.write('test123')\r\n        \r\n    malicious_vars = {\r\n        'bad_func': lambda: os.remove(test_file)\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    try:\r\n        # Try to execute the lambda\r\n        result, logs = interpreter(\"bad_func()\", malicious_vars)\r\n        assert os.path.exists(test_file), \"Security check failed - file was deleted\"\r\n        \r\n    finally:\r\n        # Cleanup if file still exists\r\n        if os.path.exists(test_file):\r\n            os.remove(test_file)\r\n\r\ntest_lambda_closure()\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThis works even though `os` is not in the whitelist of allowed modules. I _think_ this would only be an issue if a user directly imports an unsafe module within the scope of where an instance of `CodeAgent` runs, i.e. the agent can pass in something like `os.remove()` into the interpreter without importing `os` since `os` is already in scope. I'm wondering if it would be worth it to add some additional checks.

{"id":81,"state":"closed","title":"Lack of Gemini Model Integration Without LiteLLM(vertexAI)","body":"Issue Summary:\r\n\r\nThe current implementation of the smolagent does not support integration with the Gemini language model. This limitation hinders developers who wish to leverage the advanced capabilities of the Gemini model in their applications. Gemini's advanced features, such as configurable parameters (temperature, top_p, top_k), high token limits, and robust chat session management, make it a valuable addition for modern AI-driven workflows.\r\n\r\nProposed Solution:\r\nThe smolagent framework can integrate the Gemini model by defining a specialized GeminiLLM class and updating the existing infrastructure to support this new model. Below is an outline of the integration steps:\r\n\r\nGeminiLLM Class Definition: The GeminiLLM class encapsulates the configuration and interaction with the Gemini API. It includes methods for initializing the model, sending prompts, and handling stop sequences.\r\n\r\nUpdating the Agent: Modify the smolagent's architecture to include Gemini as a supported model.

If so why?\r\n\r\nI think this is a good case study to solve and make this framework more less restrictive.\r\nSo how can I make my agent work?\r\nHere is my code:\r\n```py\r\nimport json\r\nfrom action_collective import ActionClient, ActionCollectiveRequest\r\nfrom smolagents import CodeAgent, MultiStepAgent, ToolCallingAgent, HfApiModel, Tool\r\nimport asyncio\r\nfrom huggingface_hub import login, list_models\r\nfrom transformers import tool\r\nimport os\r\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\r\n\r\nload_dotenv()\r\n\r\nif not os.environ.get(\"HF_API_KEY\"):\r\n    raise Exception(\"HF_API_KEY is not set\")\r\n\r\nlogin(os.environ.get(\"HF_API_KEY\"))\r\n\r\n\r\n# Create AC tool\r\nclass ActionCollectiveTool(Tool):\r\n    name = \"action_collective\"\r\n    description = ActionCollectiveRequest.model_json_schema()[\"description\"] + \" ALWAYS USE THIS AS THE TOOL FOR CODING DO NOT DO ANY CODE YOURSELF.\"\r\n\r\n    inputs = ActionCollectiveRequest.model_json_schema()[\"properties\"]\r\n    inputs[\"relevant_data\"] = {\r\n        \"type\": \"string\",\r\n        \"description\": \"The data that will be relevant to the tool call.\",\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    output_type = \"any\"\r\n    ac_client: ActionClient\r\n\r\n    def __init__(self, **kwargs):\r\n        super().__init__(self, **kwargs)\r\n        try:\r\n            OPENAI_API_KEY = os.environ.get(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\")\r\n            if not OPENAI_API_KEY:\r\n                raise Exception(\"OPENAI_API_KEY is not set\")\r\n            self.ac_client = ActionClient(\r\n                openai_api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY,\r\n                backend_url=\"http://70.179.0.242:11000\",\r\n                verbose=True,\r\n            )\r\n        except Exception as e:\r\n            raise Exception(\"Failed to initialize ActionClient.\\n\" + str(e))\r\n\r\n    def forward(self, thought: str, tool_description: str, relevant_data: str) -> str:\r\n        str_req = json.dumps(\r\n            {\r\n                \"thought\": thought,\r\n                \"tool_description\": tool_description,\r\n                \"relevant_data\": relevant_data,\r\n            }\r\n        )\r\n        self.ac_client.chat_history = [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": str_req}]\r\n        asyncio.run(self.ac_client.retrieve_or_generate(retrieve_threshold=0.5))\r\n        asyncio.run(self.ac_client.build_action_execution_payload())\r\n        response = asyncio.run(self.ac_client.execute_action())\r\n        return json.dumps({\"response\": response})\r\n\r\n\r\n# # Test AC tool\r\n# ac_tool = ActionCollectiveTool()\r\ninput_data = \"\"\"    A = [[1, 2, 3, 4, 5],\r\n            [6, 7, 7, 9, 10],\r\n            [11, 12, 13, 14, 15],\r\n            [16, 17, 7, 19, 20],\r\n            [21, 22, 23, 24, 25]]\r\n    B = [[1, 2, 3, 4, 5],\r\n            [6, 7, 8, 9, 10],\r\n            [11, 12, 7, 14, 15],\r\n            [16, 17, 18, 19, 20],\r\n            [21, 22, 23, 24, 25]]\"\"\"\r\n# response = ac_tool.forward(\r\n#     thought=\"Need to use a tool with the ability to perform matrix multiplication\",\r\n#     tool_description=\"Takes in two matrices and returns the result of their multiplication\",\r\n#     relevant_data=input_data,\r\n# )\r\n# print(response)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Create HF API tool\r\n@tool\r\ndef model_download_tool(task: str) -> str:\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    This is a tool that returns the most downloaded model of a given task on the Hugging Face Hub.\r\n    It returns the name of the checkpoint.\r\n\r\n    Args:\r\n        task: The task for which you want to download the most downloaded model\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    most_downloaded_model = next(\r\n        iter(list_models(filter=task, sort=\"downloads\", direction=-1))\r\n    )\r\n    return most_downloaded_model.id\r\n\r\n\r\nmodel = HfApiModel()\r\n\r\n# PROBLEM IS HERE\r\nagent = CodeAgent(tools=[model_download_tool, ActionCollectiveTool()], model=model)\r\n\r\nagent.run(\"Perform matrix multiplication on the following matrices:\\n\" + input_data)\r\n\r\n# print(\"\\n\\n\\nagent.logs\\n\", agent.logs)\r\n# print(\r\n#     \"\\n\\n\\nagent.write_inner_memory_from_logs()\\n\", agent.write_inner_memory_from_logs()\r\n# )\r\n```\r\n","comments":[],"labels":[],"created_at":"2025-01-05T02:46:05+00:00","closed_at":"2025-01-06T10:20:43+00:00","patch_url":null,"repo":"huggingface/smolagents","similarity_score":null}

I found it a bit strange, that even the most simple example, when the agent is given with the only mock tool (https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents/blob/main/examples/tool_calling_agent_ollama.py) is barely working for most of the small models I tested it with. \r\n\r\nBelow is the code I was running.
