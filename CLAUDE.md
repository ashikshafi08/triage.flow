## Technical Reference Guide

### Common Development Commands

#### Backend (Python/FastAPI)

```bash
# Start development server
python -m uvicorn src.main:app --reload --port 8000

# Run tests
pytest                                    # All tests
pytest tests/test_agentic.py             # Specific file
pytest -v                                # Verbose output
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html       # With coverage

# Start Redis (optional but recommended for caching)
redis-server
```

#### Frontend (React/TypeScript)

```bash
# Navigate to frontend
cd issue-flow-ai-prompt

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Development server
npm run dev                              # Start dev server (http://localhost:5173)

# Build
npm run build                            # Production build
npm run build:dev                        # Development build with source maps

### High-Level Architecture

#### Backend Structure

The backend uses a modular architecture with these key components:

1. **AgenticRAG System** (`src/agentic_rag.py`): Central orchestrator that combines semantic retrieval with agentic capabilities. It determines whether to use simple RAG or enhance with agent tools based on query analysis.

2. **Agent Tools** (`src/agent_tools/`): Modular tools following Cognition AI principles:
   - File operations and exploration
   - Search operations (semantic and pattern-based)
   - Code generation capabilities
   - Git operations (blame, history, commit analysis)
   - Issue and PR operations
   - Two-tier LLM setup: cost-efficient model for reasoning, high-quality model for synthesis

3. **RAG Implementation**: Vector-based semantic search using FAISS with language-aware code parsing via tree-sitter.

4. **API Routers** (`src/api/`): FastAPI routers organized by functionality:
   - `/chat`: General chat interactions
   - `/sessions`: Session management
   - `/repository`: Repository operations
   - `/issues`: Issue analysis
   - `/timeline`: Timeline exploration
   - `/agentic`: Advanced agent-based queries

5. **Caching Layer**: Redis-based distributed caching with smart TTL management and index persistence.

#### Frontend Structure

React 18 + TypeScript application in `issue-flow-ai-prompt/` with:
- Custom components for chat interface, code viewing, timeline exploration
- shadcn/ui components with Tailwind CSS
- React Query for data fetching
- Smart autocomplete with @-mention support

#### Key Integration Points

1. **LLM Providers**: Supports OpenAI, OpenRouter, and Anthropic Claude models. Configuration via environment variables.

2. **GitHub Integration**: Full GitHub API integration for issues, PRs, and repository analysis.

3. **Vector Search**: FAISS indexes stored in `faiss_indexes/` directory with JSON metadata.

### Environment Setup

#### Backend (.env)
```bash
# Required
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key          # Or use OPENROUTER_API_KEY

# Optional Redis cache
REDIS_CACHE_ENABLED=true
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379
```

#### Frontend (issue-flow-ai-prompt/.env)
```bash
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

### Development Guidelines

1. **Agent Tools**: When adding new agent tools, follow the existing pattern in `src/agent_tools/`. Each tool should be self-contained with clear interfaces.

2. **API Endpoints**: New endpoints should be added as separate routers in `src/api/` and included in `src/main.py`.

3. **Frontend Components**: Follow the existing component structure. Use shadcn/ui components where possible.

4. **Type Safety**: Use Pydantic models for all API request/response validation. Frontend uses TypeScript with strict mode.

5. **Async Operations**: All I/O operations should be async. Use `asyncio` for backend concurrency.

6. **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling with graceful fallbacks, especially for external API calls.

### Testing

- Backend tests use pytest with async support
- No frontend tests are currently configured
- When adding tests, follow the existing patterns in `tests/`
