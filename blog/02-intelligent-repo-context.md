# Intelligent Repository Context Extraction: Beyond Simple Code Search

## Introduction

When we first started building our GitHub Issue Analysis tool, we quickly realized that understanding issues required more than just looking at the issue itself. We needed a way to understand the full context of the codebase - the relationships between files, the dependencies, the documentation, and the test cases. This led us to develop an intelligent repository context extraction system that goes far beyond simple code search.

## The Challenge

GitHub issues often reference code across multiple files, and understanding the full context requires more than just finding the right files. We needed to:
- Find relevant code snippets and understand their relationships
- Identify and analyze test cases that might be affected
- Locate and parse documentation that provides important context
- Track dependencies between different parts of the codebase
- Understand the broader architectural context

## Our Solution

### 1. Local Repository Analysis
```python
async def load_repository(self, repo_url: str, branch: str = "main") -> None:
    """Load repository by cloning it locally and creating a vector index."""
    with clone_repo_to_temp(repo_url, branch) as repo_path:
        documents = SimpleDirectoryReader(
            repo_path,
            exclude_hidden=True,
            recursive=True,
            filename_as_id=True,
            required_exts=self.all_extensions,
            exclude=["*.png", "*.jpg", "*.jpeg", "*.gif", "*.svg", "*.ico", "*.json", "*.ipynb"]
        ).load_data()
```

Instead of relying on GitHub's API for code search, we decided to take a different approach. We clone the repository locally and process all relevant files. This gives us several advantages:
- We can process the entire codebase at once
- We maintain the full context of the code
- We can build a searchable index that's optimized for our needs
- We can track relationships between files

### 2. Vector-Based Search
```python
# Setup FAISS vector store
persist_dir = f".faiss_index_{owner}_{repo}_{branch}"
faiss_index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(d)
vector_store = FaissVectorStore(faiss_index=faiss_index)
storage_context = StorageContext.from_defaults(
    vector_store=vector_store,
    docstore=None,
    index_store=None
)
```

We use FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for efficient similarity search. This allows us to:
- Convert code into embeddings that capture semantic meaning
- Store these embeddings in a vector database
- Perform fast similarity searches
- Maintain the relationships between different parts of the code

### 3. Context-Aware Processing
```python
def _process_file_content(self, content: str, metadata: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:
    """Process file content based on language-specific patterns."""
    if metadata["language"] == "unknown":
        return content
        
    # Extract documentation
    if metadata["doc_pattern"]:
        doc_matches = re.findall(metadata["doc_pattern"], content, re.DOTALL | re.MULTILINE)
        docs = "\n".join(doc_matches)
    
    # Extract imports
    if metadata["import_pattern"]:
        import_matches = re.findall(metadata["import_pattern"], content, re.MULTILINE)
        imports = "\n".join(import_matches)
```

Our system processes each file with language-specific patterns to:
- Extract and parse documentation
- Identify and analyze imports
- Process language-specific patterns
- Maintain the relationships between different parts of the code

## Real-World Benefits

1. **Comprehensive Context**: We can now understand the full context of any issue, including related files, dependencies, and documentation.

2. **Efficient Search**: Our vector-based search system allows us to quickly find relevant code snippets, even when they're not explicitly referenced.

3. **Language Awareness**: The system understands different programming languages and can process them appropriately.

4. **Relationship Tracking**: We can track dependencies between different parts of the codebase, making it easier to understand the impact of changes.

## Implementation Details

### 1. File Processing
- We exclude binary and non-code files to focus on what matters
- We process multiple file types with language-specific patterns
- We extract and maintain metadata about each file
- We track relationships between files

### 2. Vector Storage
- We use FAISS for efficient vector storage and search
- We maintain embeddings that capture semantic meaning
- We enable fast similarity search across the codebase
- We support incremental updates to the index

### 3. Context Extraction
- We extract relevant code snippets with their context
- We identify and analyze related files
- We track dependencies between different parts of the code
- We maintain documentation and its relationships to code

## Future Improvements

1. Add support for more file types and languages
2. Implement incremental updates to the index
3. Add dependency graph analysis
4. Improve context relevance scoring

## Conclusion

Building our intelligent repository context extraction system has been a challenging but rewarding journey. It's given us the ability to understand GitHub issues in their full context, making it easier to analyze and resolve them effectively.

What's most exciting is that this is just the beginning. As we continue to improve the system, we're finding new ways to extract and use context, making our tool even more powerful and useful for developers.
