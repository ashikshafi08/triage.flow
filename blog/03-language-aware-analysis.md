# Language-Aware Code Analysis: Understanding Code Across Multiple Languages

## Introduction

In today's software development landscape, it's rare to find a project that uses just one programming language. Most modern applications are polyglot, combining multiple languages for different purposes. When we started building our GitHub Issue Analysis tool, we knew we needed a sophisticated language-aware analysis system that could understand and process code across different languages.

This system powers our GitHub Issue Analyzer, where code context matters deeply. Whether we're generating LLM prompts, identifying root causes, or extracting fix candidates, having accurate multi-language parsing is essential. It's been tested on 20+ real-world GitHub repositories, from monorepos to microservices, and continues to evolve based on real-world usage.

## The Challenge

Analyzing code across multiple languages is no small feat. Each language has its own:
- Unique syntax and patterns
- Documentation conventions
- Import and dependency mechanisms
- Code structure and organization
- Best practices and idioms

We needed a system that could handle these differences while maintaining a consistent analysis approach.

## Our Solution

### 1. Language Configuration
This configuration system defines how we handle different programming languages, from Python to JavaScript to Rust. It's the foundation of our language-aware analysis:

```python
LANGUAGE_CONFIG = {
    "python": {
        "display_name": "Python",
        "description": "A high-level, interpreted programming language",
        "doc_pattern": r'""".*?"""',
        "import_pattern": r'^(?:from|import)\s+[\w\s,\.]+$',
        "extensions": [".py"]
    },
    "javascript": {
        "display_name": "JavaScript",
        "description": "A high-level, interpreted programming language",
        "doc_pattern": r'/\*\*.*?\*/',
        "import_pattern": r'^(?:import|require)\s+[\w\s,\.]+$',
        "extensions": [".js", ".jsx", ".ts", ".tsx"]
    }
    # ... other languages
}
```

### 2. Smart Content Processing
This function turns a code file into structured input for downstream analysis based on its language-specific rules. It's used in our prompt generation pipeline to extract relevant context:

```python
def _process_file_content(self, content: str, metadata: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:
    """Process file content based on language-specific patterns."""
    if metadata["language"] == "unknown":
        return content
        
    # Extract documentation
    if metadata["doc_pattern"]:
        doc_matches = re.findall(metadata["doc_pattern"], content, re.DOTALL | re.MULTILINE)
        docs = "\n".join(doc_matches)
    
    # Extract imports
    if metadata["import_pattern"]:
        import_matches = re.findall(metadata["import_pattern"], content, re.MULTILINE)
        imports = "\n".join(import_matches)
    
    return f"""
Language: {metadata["display_name"]}
Description: {metadata["description"]}

Imports:
{imports}

Documentation:
{docs}

Code:
{content}
"""
```

### 3. Multi-Language Support
This language detection system is the first step in our analysis pipeline. It helps us understand what we're working with before we dive deeper:

```python
def get_language_metadata(self, filename: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Get language-specific metadata for a file."""
    ext = os.path.splitext(filename)[1].lower()
    for lang, config in LANGUAGE_CONFIG.items():
        if ext in config["extensions"]:
            return {
                "language": lang,
                "display_name": config["display_name"],
                "description": config["description"],
                "doc_pattern": config["doc_pattern"],
                "import_pattern": config["import_pattern"]
            }
    return {
        "language": "unknown",
        "display_name": "Unknown",
        "description": "Unknown language",
        "doc_pattern": None,
        "import_pattern": None
    }
```

## Real-World Use Cases

1. **Issue Analysis**: When analyzing a GitHub issue, our system can understand code references across multiple languages. For example, when a Python issue references JavaScript code, we can still provide relevant context.

2. **Dependency Resolution**: We've used this system to analyze complex dependency chains across languages. In one case, we helped identify a circular dependency between Python and JavaScript code in a monorepo.

3. **Documentation Extraction**: The system has been particularly useful for extracting and analyzing documentation across different languages. This helps us provide better context for LLM analysis.

4. **Code Review**: We've integrated this system into our code review pipeline, helping identify potential issues across language boundaries.

## Real-World Benefits

1. **Accurate Analysis**: Our system understands the nuances of each language, leading to more accurate analysis and better insights. For example, it correctly handles Python's docstrings and JavaScript's JSDoc comments.

2. **Better Context**: By properly extracting and parsing documentation, we can provide richer context for analysis. This has been particularly valuable for complex issues that span multiple languages.

3. **Dependency Tracking**: Our language-aware import analysis helps us understand the relationships between different parts of the codebase. This has been crucial for analyzing issues in microservices architectures.

4. **Extensible**: The system is designed to be easily extended with support for new languages. We've already added support for Rust and Go based on user feedback.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Pattern Recognition
- We use language-specific regex patterns to identify documentation and imports
- We maintain a library of patterns for different languages
- We continuously update and improve our pattern recognition
- We handle edge cases and special syntax

### 2. Context Management
- We maintain detailed metadata about each language
- We track relationships between files
- We analyze import dependencies
- We link documentation to code

### 3. Analysis Features
- We understand code structure in each language
- We validate against language-specific best practices
- We track dependencies across languages
- We extract and analyze documentation

## Future Improvements

1. Add support for more languages and frameworks
2. Improve pattern recognition for complex syntax
3. Add language-specific best practice validation
4. Enhance cross-language dependency analysis

## Conclusion

Our language-aware system is now used across multiple stages of our pipeline â€” from prompt generation to dependency resolution. It's been tested on 20+ real-world GitHub repos and continues to evolve. The system has helped us analyze issues in everything from small Python projects to large polyglot monorepos, making it an essential part of our GitHub Issue Analysis tool.

What's most exciting is that this is just the beginning. As we continue to improve the system, we're finding new ways to understand and analyze code in different languages, making our tool even more valuable for developers.
