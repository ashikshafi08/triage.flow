# Dynamic Prompt Engineering: Adapting to Different Analysis Needs

## Introduction

If you've ever worked with large language models, you know that the difference between a mediocre answer and a brilliant one often comes down to the prompt. Early in our journey building the GitHub Issue Analysis tool, we learned this lesson the hard way. A single misplaced instruction or a poorly formatted context block could send even the smartest model off the rails. We realized that prompt engineering wasn't just a technical detail—it was the art and science at the heart of our product.

## The Challenge

Every issue, every code review, every feature request is unique. Some need a deep technical dive, others a high-level summary. Some require context from dozens of files, while others hinge on a single line of code. We needed a system that could adapt to all these scenarios, crafting prompts that were not only accurate and clear, but also flexible enough to evolve as our users' needs changed.

## Our Approach

We started by building a library of prompt templates, each tailored to a specific task—explaining an issue, suggesting a fix, summarizing a discussion. But templates alone weren't enough. We needed to make sure that every prompt was clean, readable, and free of the markdown quirks and HTML artifacts that often sneak in from GitHub or other sources. So we developed a robust markdown cleaning pipeline, stripping away noise and ensuring that every prompt was as clear to the model as it would be to a human.

Context integration was the next frontier. It's one thing to ask a model to "explain this bug," but it's another to give it the right context: the relevant code, the related documentation, the history of similar issues. Our system pulls in this context automatically, weaving it into the prompt in a way that feels natural and informative. The result? Prompts that don't just ask for answers—they set the stage for insight.

## Real-World Impact

The results have been remarkable. Teams using our tool have reported more accurate, actionable responses from LLMs, with less back-and-forth and fewer misunderstandings. In one case, a developer was able to resolve a complex issue in minutes, thanks to a prompt that surfaced the exact context needed—no more, no less. In another, a product manager used our system to generate high-level summaries for stakeholders, saving hours of manual work.

But perhaps the most rewarding feedback has come from new users, who tell us that our prompts "just make sense." They don't have to learn a new language or wrestle with confusing instructions—the system adapts to them, not the other way around.

## How It Changes the Way We Work

Dynamic prompt engineering has fundamentally changed our workflow. Developers spend less time crafting and debugging prompts, and more time solving real problems. Product teams can experiment with new types of analysis, knowing that the system will adapt. And as new models and capabilities emerge, we can update our templates and context integration strategies without missing a beat.

## Looking Ahead

We see prompt engineering as a living discipline—one that will only grow in importance as LLMs become more powerful and more deeply integrated into the developer workflow. Our roadmap includes smarter context selection, more adaptive templates, and even real-time prompt validation to catch issues before they reach the model. We're excited to push the boundaries of what's possible, making every interaction with an LLM as effective and insightful as it can be.

## Conclusion

Dynamic prompt engineering isn't just about getting better answers—it's about building a bridge between human intent and machine intelligence. By treating prompts as first-class citizens, we're helping teams unlock the full potential of LLMs, one carefully crafted question at a time. As our system continues to evolve, we look forward to empowering more users to ask better questions, get better answers, and move faster than ever before.
